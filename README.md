A Siamese neural network is an artificial neural network that uses the same weights while working in tandem on two different input vectors to compute comparable output vectors. Often one of the output vectors is precomputed, thus forming a baseline against which the other output vector is compared.

Libraries used:

* keras
* Tensorflow
* numpy
* pickle
* matplotlib
*  time
* Scikit Learn 

Please import the following versions for Keras as well as for TensorFlow:

* Keras 2.2.4
* TensorFlow 1.13.1
